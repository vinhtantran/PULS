#' Existence of Microorganisms Carried in Wind
#'
#' Data set is a part of a study on microorganisms carried in strong f\"ohn
#' winds at the Bonney Riegel location of Taylor Valley, an ice free area in the
#' Antarctic continent. Wind direction and wind speed data were obtained from
#' the meteorological station. Wind direction was recorded every 30 seconds and
#' wind speeds every 4 seconds at 1.15 meters above the ground surface. The
#' recorded wind directions and speeds were averaged at 15 minute intervals. For
#' wind direction, as discussed previously, winds from the north are defined as
#' 0/360 degrees and from the east as 90 degrees. 2007 data were collected from
#' August 4--11, 2007.

#'   \item{WS}{wind speed measured in m/s.}
#'   \item{WDIR}{wind direction in degree with 0 indicates "from the north" and
